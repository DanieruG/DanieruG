 <!-- About section -->

---
✨ I'm currently a 1st year Computer Science student at the University of Manchester!

I'm proficient in Python, and also have skill in HTML, CSS, Javascript (React.js) and TypeScript. Currently learning Java!

I mainly enjoy working on projects that aim to boost productivity. As an example, for my A-Level CompSci coursework, I worked on a website which allows people to practice conjugating verbs in French 🇫🇷.

🔭 I’m currently working on refining my web dev skills, by creating a recipe tracker website. Check out the repo if you're interested!
